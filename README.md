# Lead-Allocation-to-OGTa
The "Allocation Leads to oGT Department" script automates the process of copying leads from one Google Sheets spreadsheet to another based on specific criteria. It begins by fetching data from a designated sheet, filtering for entries marked with "oGTa" in a particular column. For each qualifying lead, it checks if the lead's name and phone number already exist in the destination sheet. If not, it appends the lead's details including name, email, phone number, faculty, field of study, and level of study to the oGTa sheet, logging the operation. The function `findFirstEmptyRow` is used to locate the first available row in the destination sheet for appending new data, ensuring no duplicates are created.
